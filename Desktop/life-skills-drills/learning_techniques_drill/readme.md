## 1. What is the Feynman Technique?
The **Feynman Technique** is a way to learn something by breaking it down into smaller parts. First, you learn it, then explain it in simple terms (like you're teaching a child). After that, find the areas where you're still confused, make notes, and review them regularly.

## 2. Most Interesting Story or Idea:
### Brain Modes:

- **Diffuse Mode:** When you relax and let your mind wander to find new ideas or solutions.

### Salvador Dali & Thomas Edison Story:
When they couldn’t solve a problem, they would sit back in a chair, hold something in their hand, and relax. As they started to fall asleep, the object would drop, waking them up. This switch from relaxed (diffuse mode) to focused thinking (focus mode) helped them solve problems.
