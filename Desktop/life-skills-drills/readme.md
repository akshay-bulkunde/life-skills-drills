# Prevention of Sexual Harassment



## What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature. It can be:
- **Verbal**: Inappropriate jokes, sexual comments, or remarks about appearance.
- **Non-verbal**: Offensive gestures, leering, or sharing explicit content (e.g., emails or messages).
- **Physical**: Unwanted touching, physical advances, or inappropriate physical interactions.
- **Hostile Environment**: Creating an intimidating, offensive, or uncomfortable workplace through actions or communications of a sexual nature.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If you encounter or witness sexual harassment, follow these steps:
1. **Report the incident** to your supervisor or HR department.
2. **Document the details**, including dates, times, and witnesses involved.
3. **Avoid direct confrontation** with the harasser if you feel unsafe.
4. **Refer to your company's harassment policies** for guidance on handling such issues.
5. **Seek external support**, such as legal or regulatory bodies (e.g., WorkSafeBC), if needed.
